        <h3>Human Processing Model</h3>
        <p>
          The Human Processing Model explains how humans handle information,
          starting with a stimulus received through the senses and briefly
          stored in sensory memory. This information is perceived, processed
          in working memory, and compared with long-term memory to make
          decisions, after which the motor system produces an action and
          feedback completes the cycle. CNNs are inspired by this process,
          especially human visual perception, as they analyze images in
          layers—first detecting simple features like edges and then
          recognizing complex patterns and objects, similar to how the human
          brain processes visual information.

        <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
        <p>
          Fitts’ Law explains how long it takes for a user to point to and
          select a target, such as clicking a button or icon. It states that
          the time required to reach a target depends on two main factors: the
          distance to the target and the size of the target. Targets that are
          closer and larger are faster and easier to select, while smaller and
          farther targets take more time and effort. This law is widely used
          in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) to design efficient interfaces,
          ensuring that frequently used buttons are large, well-spaced, and
          easy to reach, which improves speed, accuracy, and overall
          usability.

        <h3>Top-Down Approach</h3>
        <p>
          This semantic model describes the sequence of cognitive processes
          starting with sensory input captured by sensory memory (visual and
          auditory), which feeds into perception. Perception interacts with
          short-term and long-term memory, where semantic memory helps assign
          meaning. Cognition advances through thinking, involving skill
          development and mental models. Reasoning—deductive, abductive, and
          inductive—is used to analyze information. When solving problems, we
          organize perceptions (gestalt), explore potential solutions (problem
          space), and use strategies like analogy. Overall, the process flows
          from sensory perception to memory, understanding, reasoning, and
          problem-solving, supporting learning and decision-making.

        <h3>Bottom-Up Approach</h3>
        <p>
          The bottom-up approach of memory starts with sensory input, which is
          processed through perception and enters Short-Term Memory (STM). STM
          temporarily holds information and has a limited capacity described
          by Miller’s Law (7 ± 2 items). To manage this limit, information is
          organized using chunking, where smaller units are grouped into
          meaningful chunks. Because STM retains recent information more
          strongly, the recency effect occurs, allowing the last items to be
          recalled more easily. This approach highlights how memory builds
          upward from basic sensory input to higher cognitive processing.

      <h2>Cognitive Processes</h2>
      <p>
        Cognitive processes include all processes underlying mental activities
        like attention, perception, learning, memory thinking, problem
        solving, reasoning.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sensation</strong> – The process of detecting and receiving
          raw sensory stimuli from the environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attention</strong> – The mental process of brining few
          stimuli into the center of awareness out of many stimuli present.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Perception</strong> – The interpretation of sensory input to
          make sense of the environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning</strong> – The acquisition of new knowledge,
          skills, or behaviors through experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memory</strong> – The process of storing, retaining, and
          recalling information when needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Forgetting</strong> – The loss or inability to retrieve
          previously stored information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Thinking</strong> – The mental process of organizing and
          analyzing information to form ideas or solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Problem Solving</strong> – The process of identifying
          solutions to complex or unfamiliar situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reasoning</strong> – The ability to draw conclusions and
          make inferences based on information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decision Making</strong> – The process of choosing the best
          option among several alternatives.
        </li>

      <h2>Automatic Syringe Design</h2>
      <p>The automatic syringe example is a good illustration of interface design in safety-critical systems. The old
        automatic syringe design was insufficient because it relied on a standard numeric input, forcing users to
        mentally calculate or map the dosage, which increased errors and cognitive load. After consulting users, the
        design was improved by adding increment/decrement controls for each digit, allowing doses to be adjusted
        directly and intuitively. This shows that good design matters; it reduces mistakes, aligns with human cognitive
        abilities, and ensures the device is safe, efficient, and easy to use, whereas poor design can lead to confusion
        and potential risks.
